<h2 id="what-is-a-maker-space">What is a Maker Space?</h2>

<p>A maker space is a community resource where local residents can become members to gain access to equipment, classes, and workspace. At Nordeast Makers, we are particularly interested in providing access to computer controlled machinery such as CNC routers, laser cutter/etchers and 3D printers. Maker spaces are great resources for small businesses, start ups and hobbiest.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-membership-at-nordeast-makers-work">How does membership at Nordeast Makers work?</h2>

<p>Membership is $200 per month. With membership we provide basic instruction on the CNCs, lasers and 3D printers. Currently we do not offer wood shop classes, so we expect a member wishing to use the wood shop equipment will be thoroughly familiar and comfortable using it. However, we encourage and welcome you to ask other members and owners to help and/or show you how to use a piece of equipment. Our space is open 24/7 to members.</p>
