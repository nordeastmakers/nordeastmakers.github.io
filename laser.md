# Laser Cutter Guide

## Import Bitmap Files

The laser cutter can raster images from bitmap files.

- Laser Cut imports the following bitmap file formats
  - BMP, JPG, GIF, PNG, TIF, TGA, PCX

The software can only set engrave (raster) cuts for bitmaps; it needs vector drawings to set other cut types.
