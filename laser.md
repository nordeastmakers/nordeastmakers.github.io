# Laser Cutter Guide

## Import Bitmap Files

The laser cutter can raster images from bitmap files.
- Laser Cut imports the following bitmap file formats
  - BMP, JPG, GIF, PNG, TIF, TGA, PCX

The software can only set engrave (raster) cuts for bitmaps; it needs vector drawings to set other cut types.

## Import Vector Files

Use vector files to set cut lines and mark engrave areas.
- Laser Cut imports following vector file formats
  - DXF (AutoCAD)
  - AI (Adobe Illustrator 10 preferred)
  - PLT (Plotter file)
  - TST, NC
  - ECP files -- this is the native format of Laser Cut

By default the software automatically selects all embedded vectors on file import.

## Using Lasercut Software

### Associate Vectors Sets to Color Layers

If you want to order your cuts or make more than one type of cut, you need to put your vectors into layers
- Select all the vectors for a given layer
- Select a color for the layer
- Repeat selecting vectors and defining layers until all vectors are within a layer
